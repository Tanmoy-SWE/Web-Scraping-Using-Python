If we want to scrape a website:
1. Use the API
2. HTML Scraping using some tool like bs4
commands :
pip install requests
pip install bs4
pip install html5lib



#Fetching the HTML content
1. In order to work with the HTML, we will have to get the HTML as string
2. We will leverage the power of Python requests module to get this done
3. The next step then will be toparse the HTML content and give it a tree like structure so that it can be traversed

#Parse the HTML
1. Once the HTML is fetched using requests as an string, we need to parse it.
2. For parsing, we will use python's BeautifulSoup module which will create a tree like structure for our DOM

#Once the HTML is Fetched....
1. Once the HTML is fetched and parsed, the next step is to manipulate the tree using BeautifulSoup's function to get the job done
2. Then we will scrape any website and its contents into our desired format
